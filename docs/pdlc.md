## Labels

| Label | Entity | Color | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `stage:exploration` | Issue | Purple | Issue is being evaluated |
| `stage:brainstorming` | Issue | Pink | Proposed approaches awaiting PM gate |
| `stage:detailing` | Issue | Blue | Technical spec is being written |
| `stage:development` | Issue | Orange | Agent is implementing the spec |
| `spec:approved` | Issue | Green | Gate 2 — agent is cleared to implement |
| `pr:review` | PR | Yellow | Awaiting code review |
| `pr:approved` | PR | Green | Code review approved |

## Approval Gates

**Gate 1 — PM/Ideation (Brainstorming):**
You comment on the issue approving one of the approaches proposed by the ideation agent.
Format: *"Approved — proceed with option X."*

**Gate 2 — Tech Lead (Spec):**
You add the `spec:approved` label to the issue after reviewing the technical spec in the body.
This triggers the implementation agent via `agent-trigger.yml`.

## Shortcuts by Type

- **BUG** — Skips Brainstorming; enters Detail Solution with diagnostics + fix.
- **TASK** — Skips Brainstorming; enters Detail Solution with operational steps.
- **SPIKE** — Never reaches Development; delivery is a concluding comment.
- **US** — Full flow observing both gates.

## Definition of Done

An issue is truly done when:
- [ ] All Acceptance Criteria described in the body are implemented
- [ ] Tests passing: `echo "No tests/build needed."`
- [ ] No invariant violations (CI green)
- [ ] Associated PR explicitly contains `Closes #N`
- [ ] Basic manual smoke test executed after deploy (when applicable)
